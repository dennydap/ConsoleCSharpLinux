# Console C# in Linux

This is a repository of a C# Console Application, that being made using MonoDevelop.
The history behind this repository is that me and my team needed to work on C# Projects, but unfortunately I don't use Windows, so there's a gap between operating systems. I found out about MonoDevelop after a lot of searches in Google. This repo is only a test to prove that you can make C# Apps in Linux, even though there will be (maybe) some hurdles to face in the future while developing the app.
If you're interested, take a look at MonoDevelop which can be found [here](www.monodevelop.com/)
